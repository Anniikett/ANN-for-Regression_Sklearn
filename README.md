# Neural Network for Regression


We will apply regression on financial data from [Yahoo Finance! - Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) data](https://in.finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI/history?period1=1282933800&period2=1535394600&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d) to predict Close value of stock.

## [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), is a stock market index that shows how 30 large, publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. The value of the Dow is not a weighted arithmetic mean and does not represent its component companies' market capitalization, but rather the sum of the price of one share of stock for each component company. The sum is corrected by a factor which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index.

It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, created by Wall Street Journal editor and Dow Jones & Company co-founder Charles Dow. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the best known of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was originally published on February 16, 1885.



# Close Value of Stock Prediction

# Problem Statement
**Neural network is machine learning technique that try to mimic the working of neuron in human brain for learning. At first it is unstable and after certain iteration of data it adjust itself such that it’s accuracy increases. Although neural networks are widely known for use in deep learning and modeling complex problems such as image recognition, they are easily adapted to regression problems. Neural network regression is suited to problems where a more traditional regression model cannot fit a solution.**

**Build a Regression model using neural network on financial data from Yahoo Finance - Dow Jones Industrial Average data to predict close value of stock.**

# Data Description
This data frame contains the following columns attained for a particular period of time.

 Date: Trading date.

 Open: Opening price of the stock recorded during the day’s trading.

 High: Highest price of the stock.

 Low: Lowest price of the stock.

 Close: A closing price is the final price at which a stock is traded on a given trading
day.

 Adj Close: adjusted closing price of the stock.

 Volume: Number of shares traded in a given time period

# Evaluation Parameters

**Evaluation will be based on:**

 Data Preprocessing

 Model Comparison

 Model Selection

# Data Preprocessing

Normalize or Standardize the data.

# Model Comparison

Change the hyperparameters of the Neural network with regression and compare results.

# Model Selection

Select the best model. Model selection to be based on model RMSE.

# Expected Outcome
Low RMSE is expected while predicting the outcome using test data and and high coefficient of determination, R^2.
